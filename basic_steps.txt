1.command:- git remote -v 
#connection is connected to origin or not

2. to remove the origin we use command

command:- git remote rm origin

3. check now repeat step 1 again now


4.now after creating of repo

5.Before going commands first create README.md file manually

6.now use first commad
command:- git init                  #this create a git file in your woking file

7. after step 6 another commad
command:- git add README.md 

#or if u have other folder add them my same commad instead of README.md
example in my case :-  git add git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf

To know this added or not your file side letter from U to it will change to 
A this means added

8. next commad show status will show all files are commit or not which are 
pending to commit
command:-  git status

9. Think like if u want to remove file from step 7 in that we have added 
   multi files  to remove any single file we use

commad:- git rm --cached  filename
